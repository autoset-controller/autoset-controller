Repeat steps 1-6 for both computers:

1. Connect your raspberry pi to:
	a power source (via the micro-usb port)
	a monitor (via the HDMI port)
	a keyboard (via one of the USB ports)
	
	The raspberry pi should begin a boot sequence.

2. After the boot sequence completes, login with the following credentials:
	username: pi
	password: raspberry 
	(these are the default credentials for a raspberry pi.)
	

3. Configure your raspberry pi to login automatically by doing the following:
	$ sudo su (grants admin privileges indefinitely)
	# cd /etc (moves to the etc folder)
	# pico inittab (opens the initialization file in a text editor)
	change the following line:
		1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1 
		(or the closest match, there may be additional arguments in the line)
	to the following:
		1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty --autologin pi 38400 tty1
	Exit (ctrl + x), save (y), and confirm filename (enter/return).
	
	The raspberry pi should now login automatically when powered.
	To test this, type 'reboot' into the console.
	The raspberry pi should restart and boot to a shell prompt, rather than a login prompt.

4. Connect raspberry pi to internet:
	Connect your raspberry pi to your router via ethernet cable.
	# reboot
	Test your internet connection using:
	# ping -c3 8.8.8.8
	If packet loss != 100%, continue.
	Otherwise, try the following:
	# pico /etc/network/interfaces
	Rewrite the file to look like this:
		auto lo
		
		iface lo inet loopback
		iface eth0 inet dhcp

		allow-hotplug wlan0
		iface wlan0 inet manual
		wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
		iface default inet dhcp
	This will allow your router to automatically assign an ip address to your raspberry pi.
	# reboot
	Test your internet connection again. If it doesn't work, you'll have to troubleshoot on your own.

5. Install required libraries:
	Git Installation:
	This library supports the git interface, which allows for downloads of git projects.
	# apt-get install git-core
	WiringPi Installation:
	This library supports the pin interface for the raspberry pi.
	# git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
	# cd wiringPi
	# ./build

	If you encounter issues with this, go to wiringpi.com/download-and-install and follow the instructions under part A.

6. Test wiringPi:
	To confirm that wiringPi is properly installed, run the following command:
	# gpio readall
	You should see a table of pin numbers, pin modes, and pin states. Pay attention to the wPi and Physical values.
	The programs provided use the wPi numbering system.

7. Install programs:
	The platform runs on a two-brain system - one raspberry pi controls the motors, one reads the encoders.
	
	Computer A will recieve commands and control the motors. 
	Copy and build the program motorMain.c onto computer A.
	# gcc motorMain.c -o motorMain -lwiringPi

	Computer B will read the encoders, calculate position data, and send the information to the desktop.
	Copy and build the program encoderMain.c onto computer B.
	# gcc encoderMain.c -o encoderMain -lwiringPi
