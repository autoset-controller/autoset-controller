Current configuration uses pulse width modulation mode via the SyRen motor controller.

Minimum signal that produces movement is: 80
Minimum signal that produces tangible force is: 256
Maximum signal is: 1024
Field tests will need to be run to determine what the actual minimum is when the motor has weight on it.

There are multiple pins that can handle OS-level pwm signals. 
For the purpose of this project, pins 12 and 32 (1 and 26, in wiringPi) will be used.
(Alternatively, a serial packet-based control system could be used, as the motor controllers can handle that.
This decision will depend on how well the TXD (wire-based) serial connection can be established.

Pin Setup:

Motor Controller 5V: 5V (GPIO 4)
Motor Controller 0V: 0V (GPIO 6)
Motor Controller S1: 1/26 (GPIO 12/32)
Motor Controller S2: 0/2 (GPIO 11/13)

Pins must go through the circuit outlined at the following link, page 13, fig 4.2:

This will smooth out PWM and make it act as an analog output.

TODO: 
- Introduce emergency stop mechaninism (e.g. switch activated by button on side of platform.
  This stop mechanism must stop both motors until power is cycled (or until reset switch is activated).
