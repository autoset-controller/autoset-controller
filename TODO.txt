Things to do:

Logistics:
- Patent AutoSet Controller and AutoSet FreeRoam
- Trademark the AutoSet brand

Hardware:
- Fix the encoder wheel mount
- Fix charging cables
- Build a miniature prototype to demonstrate multi-platform capabilities of the software.
- Test microphone-based communication/research linear time code
- Perform reliability/distance testing for XBee
- Perform speed/weight/power testing for platform motors, generate curveset
- Perform speed/reliability testing for platform encoders
- Make tutorial for construction of platform

Drivers:
- Refactor drivers so that methods intake required inputs.
- Remove looping inside packet processing, or reduce its impact.
- Implement configuration broadcast, configuration response processing.
- Implement response for E_STOP and PAUSE.
- Make tutorial for loading drivers onto platform.

Controller:
- Implement handshakes on E_STOP, PAUSE, attribute setting, and motor commands.
- Each platform should have a window size of 1 for packet send/receive.
- Implement configuration for COM ports, xbox controller.
- Implement configuration for platforms (platform ID, platform color, attributes, etc.).
- Implement adding, modifying, and deleting cues.
- Implement cue grouping, auto-follow, and auto-continue.
- Implement drawing cues, populating waypoints.
- Implement autogeneration of waypoints when driving.
- Connect with local storage to allow saving of attributes.
- Research importing descriptor files to render stage limits.
- Ensure that platforms never go past stage limits, both when generating cues and when driving.
- Implement adding objects of varying shape and size.

Website:
- Make the website.
- Host executables, drivers, and link to github.

Backburner:
- Implement encryption?
- Implement free roaming camera.
